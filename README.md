## What is this
A simple GUI program that allows the user to supply a file path to a project they want to be hosted on GitHub. The app will also allow the user to set whether it is public or private. The program will go through the process of making the repo on GitHub, making the folder a Git repo, link the 2 together, and then perform an initial commit to GitHub.
